= A WebKit RSpec Formatter

http://deveiate.org/webkit-rspec-formatter.html


== Description

This is a formatter for RSpec 2 that takes advantage of features in
WebKit[http://webkit.org/] to make the output from RSpec in Textmate more
fun.

Test output looks like this:

== Installation

To get started, install the `rspec-formatter-webkit` gem:

    $ gem install rspec-formatter-webkit

If you're running specs in Textmate via {the RSpec
bundle}[http://github.com/rspec/rspec-tmbundle], you can use the webkit
formatter by opening Textmate's 'Advanced' Preferences and adding a
`TM_RSPEC_OPTS` Shell Variable with the value `--format
RSpec::Core::Formatters::WebKit`:

That's it!


== Miscellaneous

It's also usable anywhere else the standard HTML formatter is, of course.
Also, while it's specifically intended to be used under the Textmate HTML
viewer that the RSpec bundle uses, the output should work fine under recent
Gecko/Firefox-based viewers, as well.

Patches/suggestions welcomed.
