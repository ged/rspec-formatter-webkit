# Placeholder Gem for rspec-formatter-webkit

http://deveiate.org/webkit-rspec-formatter.html

## Description

This is a placeholder gem for the WebKit Formatter for RSpec.

The gem was renamed to 'rspec-formatter-webkit' to better 
follow standard gem-naming conventions. The new gem is a dependency 
of this one, so installing this should install the latest 
version for you, but you'll need to use the new name in the future.

You should do a 'gem cleanup webkit-rspec-formatter' to remove any
previously-installed versions if you have them.
